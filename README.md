   <h1>Dynamic Personalized Travel Safety Guide</h1>
 
   <h2>Overview 🌍</h2>
     <p>
         The <strong>Dynamic Personalized Travel Safety Guide</strong> is a real-time travel safety system designed to provide users with location-based security insights. The system uses data from multiple sources, including crime rates, live weather alerts, local incidents, and AI-driven risk assessments to ensure safe travel. It incorporates crowdsourced safety reports verified using blockchain, integrates route safety scoring, and offers forecasting for potential hazards. Additionally, the system suggests alternate routes and safe zones to avoid dangerous areas.
     </p>
     <p>
         This project leverages cutting-edge technologies such as MongoDB, React + Vite, Node + Express, and integrates Google Gemini LLM for natural language processing to provide real-time travel insights. OpenStreetMap data is also incorporated, with emojis and detailed information, for a more user-friendly experience.
